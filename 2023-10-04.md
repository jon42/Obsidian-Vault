Chem:
Learning targets:
- Sketch particle level pictures of solutions composed of soluable compounds
- Understand what makes solutions electrically conductive
- Define soluble and insoluble
- Understand solubility rules: Table 8.4 or 8.5


# Dissolving Chemical compounds:
When dissolved the ions will keep they charge.
This will cause the water molecules to orient in a direction where the opposites will attract

Ex:
In the case of $CH_{3}OH(s)->CH_{3}^{+}(aq)+OH^{-}(aq)$ the solid form will have a ${\partial}^{-}$ will be on the Oxygen and the Hydrogen will have a ${\partial}^+$. This will allow hydrogen bonding to occur between the molecules. In the aqueous form hydrogen in the water will have a partial positive that will orient toward the $OH^-$ and the partial negative oxygen will orient toward the $CH_{3}^{+}$. This will be reflected in partical level pictures by having the orientation of the molecules oriented in such that the ${\partial}^+$ will be facing ${\partial}^-$

# Conductivity
Electrical current can move freely if a solution contains freely moving ions

Electrolytes: Compounds that produce compounds hat produce ions when in a solution

Electrical current will best flow in strong electrolytes. This includes strong acids

How to tell if the electrolyte is strong:
- Covalent:
	- Either strong, non or weak
- Ionic
	- Is the compound soluble
		- Soluble: Strong
		- Insoluble: Weak

(See solubility rules table and strong acids on canvas)

# Writing Chemical equations

$$CuSO_{4}(aq)+2LiCl(aq)->CuCl_2(aq)+LiSO_{4}(aq)$$
Reactant side: Because the molecules are soluble and are aqueous they are disassociated in the water.
Product side: Also dissaciated so they are still sepparated
