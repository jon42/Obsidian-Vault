Derivatives:: Show the instantaneous slope at any point.

See [[Math Notation#Calculus Notation]] if needed 

# Formal Definition of Derivative
Formal Definition of Derivative:: $$f'(x)=lim_{h{\rightarrow}0}{\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}h}$$
# Basic Derivative Rules
Power Rule::: $$\begin{aligned} f(x) = x^{n} \newline f'{(x) = nx^{n-1}}\end{aligned}$$
Chain Rule::: $$\frac{d}{dx}f(g(x))=g'(x)f'(g(x))$$
