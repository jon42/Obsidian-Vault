# Partial Derivatives
partial [[Derivatives]] are denoted by:: $\frac{\delta{}}{\delta{}x}$ 
<!--ID: 1692597427871-->

All partials treat other variables as if they are just ordinary numbers

Example: $$
\frac{\delta}{\delta{x}}yx^2=2yx
$$
In this equation the y is just a number and normal power rule can apply

Example 2: $$
\frac{\delta}{\delta{x}}x^y=yx^{y-1}
$$
In this example the y power rule is the same however because y is still a variable it is left there and a -1 is added.
