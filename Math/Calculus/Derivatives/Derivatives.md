Derivatives:: Show the instantaneous slope at any point.

## Derivative Notation
$d/dx$ denotes a single derivative
f'(x) is the first derivative of f(x)
$\frac{d^2}{d^2x}$ is the second derivative with respect to x
f''(x) is the second derivative of f(x)
These can scale infinitely

When denoted with respect to it means that all the derivative rules will apply to that variable
# Formal Definition of Derivative
Formal Definition of Derivative:: $$f'(x)=lim_{h{\rightarrow}0}{\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}h}$$
# Basic Derivative Rules
### Deriving Functions
#### Trig Derivatives
Derivative of sin:: $$\frac{d}{dx}sin(x)=cosx$$
Derivative of cos:: $$\frac{d}{dx}cos(x)=-sin(x)$$
Derivative of tan::$$\frac{d}{dx}tan(x)=sec^2(x)$$
(Use quotient rule to understand)
Derivative of sec:: $$\frac{d}{dx}sec(x)=sec(x)tan(x)$$
Derivative of csc:: $$\frac{d}{dx}csc(x)=-csc(x)cot(x)$$
Derivative of cot::$$\frac{d}{dx}cot(x)=-csc^2(x)$$
### Rules
Addition::$$\frac{d}{dx}(f(x) + g(x))=f'(x)+g'(x)$$
Power Rule:: $$\begin{aligned} f(x) = x^{n} \newline f'{(x) = nx^{n-1}}\end{aligned}$$
Quotient rule:: $$\frac{d}{dx}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(x)g(x)-f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^2}$$


Chain Rule::: $$\frac{d}{dx}f(g(x))=g'(x)f'(g(x))$$
# Multi-variable Derivatives
## Partial Derivatives
partial derivatives are denoted by:: $\frac{\delta{}}{\delta{}x}$ 
All partials treat other variables as if they are just ordinary numbers

Example: $$
\frac{\delta}{\delta{x}}yx^2=2yx
$$
In this equation the y is just a number and normal power rule can apply

Example 2: $$
\frac{\delta}{\delta{x}}x^y=yx^{y-1}
$$
In this example the y power rule is the same however because y is still a variable it is left there and a -1 is added.
