Every single bond is a $\sigma$ bond
every bond after is a $\pi$ bond
ie: double bonds are one pi and one sigma
each triple is 2 pi and 1 sigma
 

Each hybridization happens during a different bond angle
Linear is sp yeah no shit
trig planar is $sp^2$
tetrahedral is $sp^3$

This atom has An $sp^3$ on the o as it has the 4 electron groups and $sp^2$ on c and n because it has trigonal geometry due to the pi bond pi this dick


single bonds or sigma bonds can rotate freely
when sigma bonds rotate the bond does not change

When there are pi bonds the rotation is limited because the pi bonds would break. 

When there are two $sp^2$ hybridized orbitals the other hybrid orbitals will be on the same plane 

when two atoms are connected by  double bond all other atoms they are bonded to are locked

If there is overlap between locked areas it doesn't mean they are on the same plane

Cis and trans isomers
A cis isomer has both ends drawn up or down
a trans isomer is pointed different directions kiss me

Trans

This can apply for different configurations

Molecular Dipoles
When there is a significant difference in the electronegativity of atoms that are bonded it creates a dipole moment. This will create a [[Hydrophobic and Hydrophylic|polar molecule]] that can perform Hydrogen Bonding. womp womp
