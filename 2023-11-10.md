When there is a more energy efficient state that doesnt necessarily mean that all the molecules will got to that state. It is likely that an enzyme will even reverse the reaction to create a ratio of the less energetically favourable state. This is entropic consideration

$\Delta G^{0'}$ is the difference of energy from the favourable state to the less favourable state

How to tell what proportion of the molecules will go to the more favourable state is:
$$\Delta G=\Delta G^{0'}+RT\times ln \frac{[B]}{[A]}$$
where B and A are the concentration of the product and the reactant respectively
if $\Delta G$ is negative it will go forward but if it is positive it will run backwards

For most of biology the temperature does not change much and it will stay around 0.6


Every molecules will act independently and randomly it is all based on the likelihood of going back or forward

When you have an very negative $\Delta G$ with a positive one it can give you a more energetically favourable reation. This is the purpose of atp to drive ratios. This is direct coupling

Because of the concept earlier that not all of the energetically favourable states will be achieved and their will always be a ratio it can be used to prduce more. When there is a less energetically favourable state in the middle the more energetically favourable 3rd state will draw more of the second state through. This means that there will be less of the second state so to uphold the ratio more of the first state will turn into the second state. This is indirect coupling
