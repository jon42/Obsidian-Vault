# Mitosis
Phases of mitosis
- interphase
	- G1
		- G0
	- S
	- G2
		- Mphase promoting factor
			- Cyclins/CDK
			- Cyclin increases during interphase
- M-phase
	- phases of mitosis
		- Prophase
		- prometaphase
		- metaphase
		- anaphase
		- telophase
	- Checkpoints know where the steps are
- Cytokineses: Not in mitosis
	- Plant vs animal cytokineses
- binary fision
- Centrosomes, MTOC, Centrioles
	- Types of microtubules
		- Aster
		- Polar
		- Etc
- DNA peak diagram
# Cancer
- Tumor suppressor gene
	- What happens when they are mutated and their is no control mech
- Kinds of things that are involved in cancer growth
	- Mutation of tumor suppressor
	- Protooncogenes
- Apoptosis
- Differentiated cells
	- Somatic cells
	- Stem cells
	- Cancer cells
# Meiosis
- Homologous chromosomes
- Diploid and haploid
- Aneuploidy
- polyploid
- How chromosomes change throughout meiosis
	- Meiosis 1: 2n -> n
	- Meiosis 2: n -> n but split sister chromatids
- Crossing over
- Tetrads
- Independent assortment

# Glycolysis
- Where glycolysis occurs
	- Cytosol
		- in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes
- Glucose is oxidized and NAD+ -> [[NADH]] reduction
- Glucose has more free energy
- Phosphorylation of glucose
	- Destabalizing glucose
	- ->two 3C molecules
	- 3C -> pyruvates
	- Net 2[[atp]] and NADH
	- Enzyme: [[ATPsynthase]] and H+ gradient
	-  Substrate level phosphorylation (Understand how this is different from [[ATPsynthas)
	- Endergonic vs Exergonic
		- Catabolic vs Anabolic
# Mitochondria
- Pyruvate
	- Either goes to mitochondria or fermentation
- Pyruvate -> Acetyl CoA + NADH
- Krebs and Citric acid cycle:
	- General order of the cycle
		- Oxaloacitate
			- + Acetyl CoA -> Citrate
		- Citrate
	- Produces a lot of [[NADH]] and $FADH_2$ for ETC
	- Some [[atp]] is released
	- $CO_{2}$ is released

- Cellular resperation (ETC + Glycolysis + Krebs)
# Fermentation
- Glycolysis is involved
- Running out of NADH
- Doesn't require Oxygen
- Less [[atp]] but faster
- Regenerates NAD+
# ETC
- [[NADH]] unloads its electrons to pump hydrogen
- Hydrogen gradient to create electrochemical gradient force
- Use gradient in [[ATPsynthas
	- ADP + phosphate -> phosphate
- Proton Motive force
- Final $e^{-}$ acceptor ($O_2$)
- Variable # of atp
- Process of fermentation
- Pyruvate is reduced
- Produces lactic acid/Lactate or ethenol
# Photosynthesis
- Light dependant phase
	- Gains electron from O in H2O
	- Follow electron
	- Pigment molecules and electron transfer
		- Antenna complex
	- Accessory pigments
	- Produces Energy molecules ([[atp]] and NADPH)
		- Fuels the process of making carbohydrates in calvin cycle
	- Hydrogen gradient and ATPsythase
- Calvin cycle
	- 6C is unstable(At the start)
	- Produces carbohydrates
	- Fixation of RuBp
	- Turn into 2 3C molecules
	- Reduction -> G3P (Dont need to know the name of G3P)
		- [[atp]] and [[NADH]] is added provide energy for the reaction
	- Regenerate RuBP
	- Know phases
		- Fixation
		- Reduction
		- Regeneration
	- Where glucose comes from
	- Alternate ways that photosynthesis can run (Non oxygen electron donator, only photosystem 1)
		- Test by whether $O_{2}$ is produced
