The enthalpy of a reaction is the change in energy.
It is denoted as $\Delta H$ 

# Standard Conditions
Standard conditions when talking about enthalpy is 1 atm and $25C\degree$ this is different than STP in [[Thermodynamics#Ideal gas law]]

# Endothermic
Endothermic means that it is absorbing energy from the environment. 
A positive $\Delta H$ is an endothermic reaction as it is requiring more energy. 
# Exothermic
Exothermic means that it is releasing energy from the environment. 
A negative $\Delta H$ is exothermic as it releases excess energy.
# $\Delta H$ of phases 
Each phase will take a different amount of energy to increase the temperature and to change the phases. There is often a chart that will describe what the phase changes are. 
## Specific Heat
Specific Heat is the amount of energy it takes for something to go up a degree. $$\frac{J}{g*K} or \frac{J}{mol*K}$$
These values can change based on the phase of a substance. 
## $\Delta$H Fusion and Vaporization
For a phase change to occur more energy is needed. These are denoted as $$\frac{J}{mol}or \frac{J}{g}$$
These units are important to keep track of. They can make it easier to perform calculations or harder to keep track of.
## Calculating 
If you are calculating the $\Delta$H of water you will need a chart that looks like this:

| Material | Specific Heat |
| -------- | ------------- |
|$H_{2}O_{(s)}$   |  2.11 $J/gC\degree$   |
| $H_{2}O_{(l)}$   |  4.18 $J/gC\degree$   |
| $H_{2}O_{(g)}$   |  2.00  $J/gC\degree$  |
| $\Delta H_{fus}$ | 6.0 $\frac{kJ}{mol}$  |
| $\Delta H_{vap}$ | 40.7 $\frac{kJ}{mol}$ |
If you are given 1 mole of water the that is heated from -30C to 150 the calculations would look like this:
$$
\begin{gathered}
(H_{2}O_{(s)} )2.11 \frac{J}{gC\degree} * 30C\degree * 18 \frac{g}{mol} + \\ (\Delta H_{fus})6.0 \frac{kJ}{mol} *1 mol * 1000 \frac{J}{kj} + \\ (H_{2}O_{(l)})4.18 \frac{J}{gC\degree} * 100C\degree  * 18 \frac{g}{mol} + \\ (\Delta H_{vap})40.7 \frac{kJ}{mol}* 1 mol * \frac{1000J}{kJ} + \\ (H_{2}O_{(g)})2.00 \frac{J}{gC\degree} *50C\degree * 18 \frac{g}{mol} \\ = 57163J=57.2kJ
\end{gathered}

# Hess' law
Hess' law describes the enthalpy of a reaction. The formula for Hess' Law is $$\Delta H\degree_{reaction}=\sum\limits\Delta H\degree_{f}(products)-\sum\limits\Delta {H\degree}_{f}(reactants)$$
Where $\Delta H\degree _f$ is the heat of formation at standard conditions.
