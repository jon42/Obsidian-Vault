Entropy is a measure of the number of accessible energy states or levels in which to put energy

# Microstates
Entropy can be understood by the number of microstates there are. Microstates refer to the 

# Calculating Entropy
Entropy is denoted as $\Delta S$ and is calculated by: $$\Delta S = \frac{q}{T} = \frac{\Delta H}{T}$$
Where $\Delta H$ is [[Enthalpy]] and T is temperature in kelvin
# Entropy Changes
## Entropy Change with State and Temperature
When chemicals change their state it will cause a change in entropy. As a molecule moves from a solid->liquid->gas it will increase in entropy as it increases in chaos. This will also apply to something going from solid to aqueous.

## Entropy Change from reaction
Entropy can change after a reaction happens. If a reaction causes a state change or it increases the number of moles there is then the entropy will increase.
