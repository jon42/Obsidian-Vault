Carbocations are carbons with a positive charge. 

# Carbocation stability

Carbocations stability is based on its degree of separation. The degree of separation is the number of carbons attached to the carbocation. Carbons will [[Inductive]]ly stabilize and give some of their charge to the carbocation. This will allow the carbon to be much more stable
Stability can also come from [[Resonance]] stabalization
**Order of stability**:
Methyl < $1\degree$ < $1\degree$ + resonance < $2\degree$ < $2\degree$ +resonance or $3\degree$ < $3\degree$ +resonance

# Carbocation rearrangement
Carbocation rearrangements occur when there is a more stable carbon adjacent to the carbocation 
For a carbocation to shift a hydrogen or methyl group must shift to the current carbocation. 
This is illustrated using [[Curved Arrow]] Notation.
An important thing to note about carbocation rearrangement is [[Stereochemistry]] is destroyed
