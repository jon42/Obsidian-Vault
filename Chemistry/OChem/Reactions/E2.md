E2 is a subsitution reaction
# [[Rate of Reations|Rate]]
The 2 in E2 refers to the reaction being dependent on the concentration of both molecules. 
E2 = k\[Attacking Species]\[Electrophile]
# Reaction Conditions
[[Solvation#Aprotic]] solvent 
**HEAT**
Strong [[Nucleophiles and Electrophiles#Bases]]
- Attack Hydrogen
# Reaction Progress
- All of the reaction occurs in one step
- The attacking group attacks the hydrogen
	- The hydrogen must be anti to the bond molecule that is leaving. This means that it must be a wedge and a dash or both dashes
- The hydrogen gives its electron to form a pi bond with the carbon attached to the leaving group. 
- The leaving group leaves
- Products
	- There are different types of products that can form. 
	- If there is is a small base the most substituted alkene is formed ([[Functional Group#Alkene stability]])
	- If there is a large base the less substituted base is formed
