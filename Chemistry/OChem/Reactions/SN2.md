An SN2 reaction is another substitution reaction
# Rate
The 2 in the SN2 is because the rate is determined by the concentration of 2 species. Both the concentration of the [[Nucleophiles and Electrophiles]] matter
Rate: SN2 = k \[[[[Nucleophiles and Electrophiles|Nuc:]]]\[[[[Nucleophiles and Electrophiles|E]]]
# Reaction Conditions
[[Solvation#Aprotic]] solvent 
Neutral Heat/less heat
$1\degree$ or $2\degree$ carbon
Strong [[Nucleophiles and Electrophiles#Nucleophiles]]
- Negative atom 

# Reaction Progress
- This only has one step in the reaction
- The only thing that happens is the Nuc does a backside attack of the electrophilic atom
- Stereochemistry is reversed on the new atom
