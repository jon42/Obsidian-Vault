Ideas of improving my own life through purposeful actions
# The science of well-being
- GI Joe Fallacy: a concept that knowing is not half the battle. Work has to be done to change the behaviour
- How accurately do people predict their own satisfaction of dissatisfaction from an event:: People typically over estimate the impact of an external event
- Savouring and gratitude: Savouring and realising gratitude can increase happiness as it draws more attention to what is already good in your life. 
- Thinking about stuff can make you less happy. Gaining something you think that you want has little to do with life satisfaction. This is also extending to weight loss, grades, and cosmetic surgery. In fact some of these things can reduce some of the satisfaction.
- intentional and effortful activities have the greatest impact on happiness. Not events
# The subtle art of not giving a fuck
This is a book about what creates good values. Choosing what you value makes you choose what to give a fuck about. What does not suite your values you will not give a fuck about.

key takeaways:
- What makes a good value: You have control over it, it is realistic, it is relative to internal events not external. These mean that you must make a value that you achieve for yourself not others. This means that being popular is a poor value as you are not relying on yourself. But honesty is something that can be achieved internally
- The cycle from hell: This is the cycle in which your own self pity creates you to do more things that pity yourself. This is not necessarily pity. (Example: I hate that I haven't done this work so I'm gonna sit and watch tv to make me feel better, then I feel like even more of a failure because I continue to not achieve.)
- Understanding that you are not yet what you want to be is what will get you to the point where you want. Great people become great because they know they are not great. 
- Negative feelings:
	- Negative feelings are unavoidable. Trying to avoid them will only lead to them building up. Understand what negative feelings you are willing to tolerate allows you to move your values and actions to negative feelings you can handle.
	- Negative feelings can be used as a call to action. Negative feelings are a natural response to something that you are unhappy with. This can be a good guide as to what you need to focus on in life.
- You are responsible for everything in your life. Even if some tragedy happens you are still the one responsible for your own actions. This does not mean that you are at fault and it is important to make this separation. But you are the only one making the decisions on what you do with yourself next.
- Backwards Law: The idea that actively pursuing happiness for the sake of happiness will bring you farther away from it.
- Failure is progress. If you use doing something instead of doing something right as a metric every action becomes positive. (Example: Getting a job vs applying. Applying is a better step because it is achieved internally)
