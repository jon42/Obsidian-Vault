- When I'm Going to graduate
	- Financials of graduating early
		- It seems like it is possible but will be a challenege. I can't do upper division courses till im in the major
	- Summer classes
		- Summer classes work fine I just have to insure that I can transfer them. I can also do them here and get into upper bio courses as long as I am in the major by spring
	- Course progression and advised classes
		- Just as I thought
- Double major
	- It is useful but I have opportunities while in grad school
	- Getting into lee lab is #1 priority
