Evolution is when there is genetic change in a population.

# Key Terms
### Fixation
Fixation is the process of an allele becoming totally dominant and no other allele exists
### Fitness
Fitness it the ability of an individual to reproduce
### Relative Fitness
The Fitness of an allele compare to other alleles
### Adaptations
The Evolutionary trait that increases fitness
# Acclimation
An adjustment in physiology or morphology that reduces the physiological stress
# Causes of Evolution
There are several types of evolution
## Natural Selection
Natural selection is the most well known cause of evolution. Natural selection is when there is a pressure that reduces the amount of offspring that can produce viable offspring. This can be something as simple as coat color making an individual less visible and thus increasing its chance of surviving
## Genetic drift
Gene drift is a random shift in genetic proportions. This can be because of a natural event or just random chance. This is typically a very slow form of evolution
## Selective Mating
Selective mating is just as it sounds. Species will mate with a specific species less and reduce its allelic proportion
## Gene Flow
Gene flow is the introduction of genetic material from one population of a species to another. This can reduce adaptation but increase genetic variation. This does not change the total allelic proportions although it will change local allelic proportions. 
## Mutation
Mutation is random changes in DNA that result in new alleles. For these alleles to actually affect allelic proportion they must be viable and advantageous. This is the most important for creating genetic variation

# Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
The Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium refers to a concept of a species that when it reproduces each genotype will be proportion the the proportion of an allele that exists. This is to say that if there is 50% R and 50% r there should be 25% RR and rr as well as 50% Rr. The general equation for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is $$p^2+2pq+q^2$$ where p and q are the two alleles. The output for each of these sections are the proportion of that allelic combination. 
Example: 
A population has 400 RR 200 Rr 350 rr. This means that there is 1000 R and 900 r alleles. This turns into 53% R and 47% r(The ratio of an allele to the total amount of alleles. If the population was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium it would have $0.53^{2}=0.28$ RR $2*0.53*0.47$ 0.5 Rr and $0.47^2=0.22$ rr. This species is not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium as it does not have those ratios
