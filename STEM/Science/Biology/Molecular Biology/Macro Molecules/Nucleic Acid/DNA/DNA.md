DNA is a [[Molecule]] that is the instructions on how a [[Cell]] should operate. [[Amino Acid#Isoleucine]]
DNA has phosphate backbone $PO^{3-}_4$ with a pentose [[Saccharide]]
DNA takes on a right hand double helix shape

DNA is made of [[Nucleotide|Nucleotides]] that encode everything that happens in the cell.

DNA is not very useful on its own so it is [[Transcription|Transcribed]] into [[RNA]]. This transcription is performed by [[RNA Polymerase]].

## How is DNA useful
DNA is a very stable molecule. With the formation of the molecule it is something that is able to maintain the same order of [[Amino Acid]]s. DNA is such a good storage unit that a single strand can hold 215 petabytes of information. DNA can even be encoded to store movies.
