Population is all of the organisms of a species interaction.
Terms:
Population Density:: The Number of individuals devided by the area
Dispersion:: The spatial pattern that the organisms are dispersed in. There are three types of dispersion: uniform, clumped, and random. All of them are just as they sound
Dispersal:: The movement of the individuals within a population.
# Population Growth
There are several different types of growth depending on the rate that the population is growing at
# Exponential Growth
Exponential growth is growth that increases as the population increases. The standard rate is written as $$Ne^{rt}$$$$\frac{DN}{DT}=rn$$
N: the population size
r: the rate that the reaction occurs at
t: time that the reaction occurs at
# Logistic growth
