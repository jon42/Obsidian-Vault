Fluids take the form of its surroundings
Fluids refer to both [[Liquid]] and [[Gas]]

# Pressure
Pressure is defined as the force over an area

P  or $\rho$ Denotes pressure

The standard unit for pressure is the Pascal [Pa]

There are a few pressure equations:

- P = [[Force|F]] / [[Area]]
- P = [[Density|p]] * [[Gravity|g]] * height
- P = [[Mass|m]] / [[Volume|V]]

For an instance when an item is underwater it is the pressure from the air + pressure from the liquid at that depth
# Buoyancy

Buoyant force is the upward force applied to an object in water

$F_{Buoyant} = pVg$
$F_{B} = F_{up} - F_{down}$

Where 
- F is [[Force]]
- p is [[Density]]
- V is [[Volume]]
- g is [[Gravity]]

# Flow rate
Flow Rate:: Change in volume over the change in time $$Q = \lim_{\Delta{}{t\to\infty}} \frac{\Delta{V}}{\Delta{t}}=\frac{dV}{dt}$$

## Bernoulli Equation
The Bernoulli equation:: $$P_1+\frac{1}{2}pv^2_1+pgh_1=P_2+\frac{1}{2}pv^2_2+pgh_2$$

Bernoulli's equation basically says that with the change of the velocity, height, or pressure other variables must change
