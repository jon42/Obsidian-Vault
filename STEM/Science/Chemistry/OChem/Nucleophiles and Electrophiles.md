Electrophiles and Nucleophiles are atoms within a molecule that do chemistry. These atoms are the atoms that will break a bond/form a new bond. An molecule can have a nucleotide and an electrophile in it and it will react with either of them
# Nucleophiles
Nucleophiles: Love nucleus. Want to bind with +
Nucleophiles are atoms in a structure with a $\delta^-$ Charge or a full negative charge. 
These species are referred to as the attacking species as it attacks the Electrophile. 
**The more stable the nucleophile the weaker it is**
In reactions these can sometimes be referred to as a $Nuc:^{-}$


## Bases
[[Acids and Bases|Bases]] are a type of nucleophile
Bases are specifically nucleophiles that attack a hydrogen
Anything stronger than $OH^-$ is a base.

# Electrophiles
Electrophiles: Love electrons. Want to gain electrons
Electrophiles are atoms in a molecule with a $\delta^+$ charge or a full positive charge. 
 These species are attacked by the Nucleophile
