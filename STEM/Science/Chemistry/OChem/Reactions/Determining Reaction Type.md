As there are many different types of reactions it is important to understand what conditions cause each of the reactions
1. If there is no carbon adjacent to the carbon with the leaving group it must be substitution
2. If there is heat added it will likely do an elimination
3. If there is a big bulky base it will do an [[E2]] 
4. If it is $3\degree$ substituted carbon it will likely be an SN1
5. If it is a $1\degree$ carbon it will likely be and SN2
6. Otherwise the stronger attacking species favors SN2 and E2
