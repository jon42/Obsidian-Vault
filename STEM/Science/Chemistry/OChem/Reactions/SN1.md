SN1 is a substitution reaction. 
# [[Rate of Reations|Rate]]
The 1 in SN1 refers to the reaction rate being dependent on only the slow step
This limiting molecule is in relation to the leaving group
SN1 = k\[[[Nucleophiles and Electrophiles#Electrophiles]]] 
# Reaction Conditions
- [[Solvation#Protic]] solvent
- Neutral temp/less heat
- $3\degree$ or $2\degree$ carbon
- Weak [[Nucleophiles and Electrophiles#Nucleophiles]]
	- Neutral or halogen attacking species
# Reaction Progress
1. Leaving group leaves
	1. Sometimes a good leaving group must be created for the leaving group can leave. For this to happen a more stable leaving group must be created. An example of this is with an [[Functional Group#Alcohol]] may be protenated by water so that when it leaves it becomes water
2. Check for [[Carbo-cations#Carbocation rearrangement]]
3. Attacking nucleophile attaches to the new carbocation
4. There is no [[Stereochemistry]] as the carbocation is $Sp^2$ hybridized
