E1 is an elimination reaction
# [[Rate of Reations|Rate]]
The 1 in E1 refers to the reaction only being dependant on only the slow step
The slow step is the leaving group
[[Rate of Reations|rate]]: E1 = k\[leaving group]  
# Reaction Conditions
- **HEAT**
	- Heat is the most important distinguishing feature for E1 reactions.
	- This is sometimes indicated with a $\Delta$
- Protic solvent
- Weak [[Nucleophiles and Electrophiles#Bases]]
	- This is a uncharged molecule or halogen that attacks a hydrogen
# Reaction Progress
1. Leaving group leaves
2. [[Carbo-cations#Carbocation rearrangement]] occurs
3. Attacking species attacks halogen
4. [[Molecular Bonds# Pi bond]] forms
