A polar molecules is a molecule in which the electron is pulled more towards one end of the molecular bonds making one of the molecules slightly positive and the other slightly negative. If two polar molecules bind together with the positive of one and the negative of the other it is a [[Molecular Bonds#Hydrogen Bonds]]. if the electronegativity of the two atoms in a molecule is >0.4 it is polar

to denote that an atom is polar it is denoted with a $\delta$ with a $\delta{^+}$ or $\delta^-$ denoting if it is positively or negatively charged
