# Bronsted-lowry Definition
Acid: A molecule that gives up a proton/Hydrogen ion
Base: Anything that accepts a proton

These definitions are broad and encompass many things. An odd example of a base is water. Although its pH is 7 $H_{2}O$ can obtain another hydrogen atom to become hydronium ($H_{3}O$). This is important to see who is the receptor and who is giving when defining an acid or a base.

# Strength of acids and bases
### Strong Acids
Strong acids are acids that will fully dissociate in water.
These consist of the halogens(excluding Fluorine) nitrate and sulfate
### Strong bases 
Strong bases typically include a hydroxide group attached to a metal. They start with the group 1 but include others such as calcium
## Strong acid and base table

| Acid | Base |
| ---- | ---- |
| HCl | LiOH |
| $HNO_3$ | NaOH |
| $H_{2}SO_4$ | KOH |
| HBr | $Ca(OH)_2$ |
| HI | $Sr(OH)_2$ |
| $HClO_4$  | $Ba(OH)_2$ |
| $HCLO_3$ |  |
# Oxoacids
Oxoacids are a group of acids with the general formula $H_{n}EO_m$ where E is another element such as a non metal or an early transition metal
There are several trends that may effect the strength of the Acid
- In homolgous series acidity increases with electornegativity
- As oxidation of central atom increases the acidity increases
	-  This increases stability of base 
	- This occurs when there are more oxygens bound to the central atom
		- HOCl: pka = 7.4
		- HOClO: pka = 1.96 (Smaller is stronger)
- Acidity decreases when a proton is removed
	- This would be indicated by a - at the top of the molecule


# Characteristics of Acids
- Chorosive
- Tastes sour




Amphoteric: a substance that can act as either an acid or a base
Amphiprotic: A substance that can either accept or donate a proton. This is specific to the bronsted lowery definition but they are effectively synonyms
