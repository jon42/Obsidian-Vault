## RNA end Caps
After RNA is [[Transcription|Transcribed]] a 5' cap and a poly-[[Nucleotide#Adenosine|Adenosine]] cap is added.

## Alternative spicing
Alternative splicing is when the [[Introns]] and exons are removed and different combination of [[Exons]] are used. By including or exluding [[Exons]] the final [[mRNA]] can create different [[Proteins]] that can serve different purposes. [[mRNA#Pre-mRNA|Pre-mRNA]] is the term for the mRNA before it is spliced
