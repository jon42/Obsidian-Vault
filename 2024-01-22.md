# Big idea 2
Covalent bonds consist of electrons shared between atoms. This means that the electrons are delocalized

The metals use S orbitals to be filled the non metals use p orbitals to be filled
the number on the orbital is related to the period that they are in. 

When a covalent bond they overlap orbitals. The first bond is called a $\sigma$ sigma bond. 

Florine would have 2 in 1S, 2 in 2S orbital, and 5 in 2P. This means that it has one remaining in the 2P orbital

P orbitals have 6 possible electrons.

Carbon would have 2 in s1, 2 in S2, and 2 in P2. This means that it leaves 4 left to be filled. Carbon will have a $p_x$ and a $p_{y}$ orbital. Carbons bonds must be tetrahedral

When these are bound the electron orbitals will overlap. Knowing the type of orbital it is in determines how they overlap

When there is a model that does not work in a tetrahedral it will become a hybrid between s and p orbital. one s and 3 p orbitals make the $sp^3$ 
These hybrid orbitals will be at 109$\degree$ in three dimensions
$sp^3$ bonds occur when 4 $\sigma$ bonds occur
These hybrids can still make $\sigma$ bonds
if oxygen is used to make a $\sigma$ bond it will need to hybridize
Any time there are 4 orbitals needed they need to be at 109$\degree$ they need to be hybridized. 


amonium would have $sp^3$ with sp$^3$ bonds with s bonds in the hydrogen


#todo Add pictures and practice the drawings. This will be on the exam
