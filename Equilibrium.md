Most reactions in Chemistry are reversible. The forward and backward reactions just happen at different rates so that the forward reaction may just happen much more than the reverse, appearing as if it only goes forward. 

# Equilibrium Constant
The Equilibrium Constant is denoted as $k_{eq}$. The K value changes depending on the temperature.

## Calculating Equilibrium
As mentioned before the equilibrium is the forward and backwards reaction. This means that it is relative to the [[Rate of Reations]] of the forward and the reverse reaction. 

 The general equation is:
$$
\begin{gathered}
A+2B=AB_{2}\\
k_{eq}=\frac{[AB_{2}]}{[A][B]^{2}}
\end{gathered}
$$
$k_{eq}$ also has a direct relationship with [[Gibbs Free Energy]].
$$
\begin{gathered}
\Delta G \degree = -RT ln(k_{eq}) \\
-\frac{\Delta G \degree}{RT}=ln(k_{eq})
\end{gathered}
$$
# Le Chatelier's principle
This principle refers to the relationship between equilibrium and kinetics. Kinetics referring to pressure, temperature, and concentration

# Concentration
