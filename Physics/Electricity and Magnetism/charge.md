Particles can be positively charged, negatively charged, or have no net charge
Apposing charge attracts and charges with the same charge repel

# Coulombs law
Coulombs law:: $$F_e=\frac{k|q_1*q_2|}{r^2}$$ where q is the charge of the two particles. [[Force|F]] is the force. k is $9*10^9\frac{Nm^2}{c^2}$
Charge creates a field around it in which the magnitude decreases over the distance
# Net electric field
Net electric field:: $$E_{net}=k \frac{Q_1}{r^{2}} + k \frac{Q_{2}}{r^{2}}$$
