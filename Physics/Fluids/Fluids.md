Fluids take the form of its surroundings
Fluids refer to both [[Liquid]] and [[Gas]]

## Pressure
Pressure is defined as the force over an area

P  or $\rho$ Denotes pressure

The standard unit for pressure is the Pascal [Pa]

There are a few pressure equations:

- P = [[Force|F]] / [[Area]]
- P = [[Density|p]] * [[Gravity|g]] * height
- P = [[Mass|m]] / [[Volume|V]]
