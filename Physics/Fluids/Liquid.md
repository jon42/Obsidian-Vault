Compression: Liquids are compressible however the effect of the compression is negligible. Thus there is no impact of compression in any calculations

## Buoyancy

Buoyant force is the upward force applied to an object in water

$F_{Buoyant} = pVg$
$F_{B} = F_{up} - F_{down}$

Where 
- F is [[Force]]
- p is [[Density]]
- V is [[Volume]]
- g is [[Gravity]]
