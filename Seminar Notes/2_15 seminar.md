Title:Forgottenen Giants,
The past present and future of the basking sharks in the salish sea and beyond

Speaker Romney McPhie

There is history of slaughtering basking sharks

Purpose is to talk about basking sharks: General description, Biology, history, and current status

One of the largest and least understood creatures

second largest fish in the world

They are about 40 ft long. 6-7 tons in weight
They liver alone can weight 1000 lbs
basking sharks are filter feeders
"Gill rakers" are gill slits and increase surface area for filter feeding
the mouths can be 1m across

they typically cruise at 2 knots and only close their mouth every 30-60 seconds
This differs from other shark filter feeders who use a pumping motion to gain food.

PNW coast is very plankton rich
historically in the fall and winter the sharks would go to california
this seasonality led us to think that there is only one population
Recent data the seasonal patterns  appear to have shifted.

The basking sharks move throughout the ocean a lot. 

These sharks are vulerable to decline:
- Late age at maturity (16-20 years)
- long-lived
- long gestation period 
- small litter size
- low natural mortality

Basking sharks used to be abundant in the pnw. There was a long history of exploitation that was fueled by the media. They described basking sharks as salmon killing monsters but that was never true

Small scale fishing and whaling occurred between 1910-1940 but there was a directed fishing that occurred in 1941-1947

They moved alongside the salmon which led to the misconception

By 1948 there was a bounty put on basking sharks as they were destructive to fishing gear
They made canadas "List of destructive pests" in 1949

Eradication was endorsed in 1955

The most cost efficient  eradication program was a large knife in the front of a ship
In the 14 years it was used it killed 413 sharks

By 1970 the slaughter had ended. Between 1920 and 1970 1000-2600 sharks were killed in Canadian waters alone

estimates were that there were only 500 left

California study showed a decline in population and school size form 1960-2018

In 2010  they were added to the endangered species risk act.
in 2020 an action plan was created. 

There are severa current threats

- Collisions with vessels 
- illegal harvest
	- One of the parts can be worth $50k
- prey availability
- Harassment
- Bycatch

How to improve the situation
- Improve research
	- There is newer research where satellites can track the sharks
	- Use community spot the shark project to track these sharks
	- There have been recent sightings in the salish sea
		- There was a basking shark that swam up to a families boat in 2014

Why does it matter?
- Historically the view on these sharks were very bad
- Recent descriptions are far more positive than before

No real natural prey
