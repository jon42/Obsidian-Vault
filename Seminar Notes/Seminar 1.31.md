We know very little about meningeal biology
It is not clear how current menengial tissue idorders occur and why it is happening.
As mammals we have a very strong skull
Important questions

Dr. Venero used zebra fish to study meninges

The zebra fish skull is very thin and semi transperant. This allows for viewing of the brain andmeninges fo rbetter study. 

Q1: Are all  meninges alike?
Current literature is from the early 1900s and the studey of the minges of different animals

# The Zebrafish Meninges
In a mamal there are 3 layers
- Dura mater
	- Made of 2 layers
- Arachnoid Mater
	- The leptomeninges
- Pia Mater

Q: Do zebrafish have similar meninges
There were multipple layers observed but it was unknown whether it was the same as in humans

Using staining it was shown that mouse and zebrafish have similar layers

Using electron microscopy 3 zones were shown withing the zebrafish menninges
There was also concentration of collegen that were shown
As well other similar anatomical features were sown

A dataset was collleceted of what cells are within the zebrafish meninges at different levels
This allowed an anlysis of the structure and other cell processes happening within the mininges

One important cell is FGPs
these are all throughout the brain an not found anywhere else in the zebrafish. 

What do FGPs do?
- When ink was introduced the FGPs were able to uptake it in vesicles
	- This indicated that FGPs uptake foreign substances
- FGP does not show enrichment of paracyte, macrophages
- FGPs express lymphatic markers

The lymphatic system maintains fluid homeostasis, transport macromolecuels, and removes waste from tissues

When there is an error in the lympbatic system it is called lymphedema. Primary lymphedema is rare natural disorder. Secondary comes from a disease or an accident.

The lymphatic vessels align with the meningeal dural

The zebrafish has lymphatic cell that developed later than expected
They were initialy overlooked as the zebrafish was less useful for research after a few weeks old

FGPs are developed within the first several days of fertilization

FGPs are leptomeningeal perivascular cells
they do nt have hematopoeietic origin

There is another cell ependymin that is expressed exclusively in the meninges
they are surrounding the brain. These only cover specific parts of the brain

The epds are sorounding the FGP

Now with the knowledge of the EPD a full structure can be better understood

Current research includes ablating EPDs to see what the effect was. When the brains were observed they had severe problems around spots that the EPDs are there. They were still alive so they were studied over time. After the ablation embryo survival was greatly reduced

EPDs are major brain wrapping ceell
EPDs en sheath other leptomeningeal cells
Ablation lead to disruption of vascular and neural structures

New strategies are allowing new imaging of the fish over the development of the embryo. This should allow better understanding of the purpose of meninges.


If there is an attempt of ablating FGPs it will also ablate the lymphatics as they show similar markers. new markers are being found that may allow for this resesarch to go through.
