This is a seminar on raven communication by Douglas Wacker, professor at UW-Bothell

Title: Ravens Calling in a Random Forest: Using Machine learning to Describe Corvid Vocal Communication

This research was done in Alaska

There are a few things that distinguish crows and raves:
- Fancy throat feathers
- Wedge shaped tails
- Croaks not caws
- Does a barrel roll

There are no crows in Alaska so they have taken over that niche

We listened to some Raven calls and payed attention to pitch, volume, noise, and duration

There were caws, chirping, caws with chirps and some throat noises, and a click
this is what makes the ravens so interesting 

Ravens are also social animals so their communication is important. They are also an intelligent species. They were able to figure out how to get food by pulling a rope, they were able to do this without seeing before hand. This also distinguishes crows as the crows just flew at the food.

Core questions:
- How do we catergorize raven call types?
- What doe all those raven call types mean?
- Why have these questions been difficult to answer


There are different studies that differ the number of types of call types there are. 15, 35, 18, 116, 79 call types



Key term: 
- Spectogram: a graph of sound frequencies

One of the issues with the previous research is they all named sounds differently. This makes agreement in the field very challenging. 

Machine learning was used to categorise the calls
