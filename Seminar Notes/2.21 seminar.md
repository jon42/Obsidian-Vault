Congenital heart defects
Why is it important
- it is one of the most frequent heart defects
	- normaly structural changes in the development of the hear. 
	- There are several types of mutations
		- ventricular septal defect
		- tetrology of fallot
- Its thought that these defects are genetic
- It is thought that there are over 100 genes that can effect CHD in humans
There are some genes that are relavent to several different effects in CHD
There are genes found in multiple publications and families
Large scale sequencing is being performed to find the CHD

More than 55% of the effects are still unkown

There could be multiple mutations that are combined to create a CHD. These make it far more complex of the combination of genes that may cause these effects

A study used a database to find the genes that have a high "Heterozygote selection value" these genes are genes that do not present CHD's

These top genes are able to be heterzygotes and not cause defects

By comparing these genes to genes expressed in heart development it is used to determine the possible genes that may mutated to cause a defect.

A protein protine interaction analysis of candidate and known CHD Genes to compare the genes that are candidates for interactions with the CHD

By analysing networks of known genes and suspected genes it helped linked genes to each other and understanding of the defects

The proteosome is apart of the ubiquitin proteasome system
The proteasome takes a targeted protein and may move it to degridation
There were several related genes that appeared to be related but were not previously thought to have an association
This is where zebrafish come in
# How do we test these heart development
- Zebrafisha have similar heart development to the development of mammalian heart
- The heart develops within 48 hours of development
- The zebrafish only have 2 chambers while we have 4

CRISPR is used to analyze the effects of the genes
- CRISPR is injected into the zebrafish eggs
- CRISPR can effect the desired genes 
- The fish can then be analyzed to see the role of the proteasome genes

 After some of the genese were edited there were several differences shown that were similar to those that exist in humans

After several genes were knocked out several of them showed high rates of birth defects in combination with other mutations. 

Some of these mutations created a stop codon in the middle of a gene and created a severe loss of a protein.
This allowed to create a mutant line to study the effects of this mutation. (Pomp mutation)

This shared some phenotype similarities to another mutation that had been discovered (psmd6)

There was a study that showed that a mutation in a related gene that showed very similar effects to those that were in zebrafish

outflow tracts are reqduced in pomp

There has also been a biochemical aproach to the analysis
If the proteasome has been disrupted an increase of ubiquitin proeint is expected
when a wester staining from lysates from these modified species there was an increase in ubiquitin proteins. 

Then an analysis of the difference of the mutants compared to other functional versions of the genes

in addition to the biochemical approach a genetic approach is also important
There was a network analysis to compare the effects of the proteins modifications on different parts of cells. 
The genetic approach may give a better understanding on the interactions between proteins. 

The psmd6 was determined to be lethal to mouses
Unfortunately there were no embryos that were available


This is a new approach to identify candidate CHD genes
Proteasome factors share developmental function
Results underscore the value of zebrafish genetics
