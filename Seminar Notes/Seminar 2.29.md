Title: Sustaining Marine Bounty in the Modern Age: Creative Solutions for Restoration of Salish Sea Species and Habitats
Speaker: Jodi Toft
College of the environment * Salish sea institute

This is a small non-profit dedicated to sustaining the Salish sea species and habitat

Books:
- Hope matters
- All we can save
- Home waters

There is a depth of community partnerships and organizations that come together to make progress in the Salish sea

When they approach restoration they look at the biology of the species in the area to understand how the organisms are and will react to the changes that have happened and will happen
They also look at how the species impact their environment and how as they are restored the impact will change

They often start in a hatchery to do small scale research to better understand the organism
They continue to use outplanting to increase the species
The efforts are then scaled to multiple site to scale the impact

Programs
- Olympia oysters
	- This is the first species that they started restoring
	- The Olympia oyster was used as a food source during the gold rush and it deteriorated the population
	- Bringing the species back
		- Seed enhancement, spat-on-shell
			- This is where they learn how the species grows and reacts the their environment
			- For the oysters they collect the oysters and warm the water to produce larvae
			- they our larvae into nutrient rich land and then let them grow
			- After they are grown they return them to their environment
		- Seed enhancement, singles
			- They place the larvae onto microgultch and raise them individually 
			- They are grown in bags for a few years and reproduce
			- This puts the larvae back into the water and produces profit for the growers
		- Shell enhancement
			- Reintroduce shell into the environemt so that the larvae has a place to settle
			- These shells are put out in mass
	- Basket cockles
		- recently there has been a large reduction in the basket cockles and a tribe has been working closely to improve the population
		- Cockles often recruit to a gooey duck tube
		- This allowed the researchers to sue an existing gooey duck farm to understand cockles
		- Research has shown that there is little risk of genetic issues when relocating cockles to new locations to improve the population

Broadening the definition of restoration: Ecology culture and relationships
Building all of these things are important to successful restoration
- abalone
	- Another species is an abalone and is grown in a hatchery and then they are being reintroduced to their natural habitat
	- There have been about 50000 abalones reintroduced into the environment
Studies are being done to help produce more abalone to be reintroduced into the environment

Bull kelp
- There used to be a large forest of bull kelp that is no longer there
- This is something that they did not know how to restore it
- This forest was gone in the 90s but it in the progress of being restored
They are building sentinels to have an array of information that is going down to the levels that the kelp would exist


There is a new project in which they use community to produce kelp farms
They are given materials to do kelp gardens
This project is only about a week old

There is another community engagement effort in which they use light traps to search for a life stage of a crab

There is a community oyster farm that was closed from harvest
They analyzed the water quality to improve the health of the oysters so it was able to be harvested in only 3 years

Interest in the green crab problem
