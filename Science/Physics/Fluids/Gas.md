Gasses will fill any space
this means that any number of gas molecules can fit any size

## Ideal gas law

The ideal gas law states that $PV = nRT$

This equation gives rise to many equations that relate two of the variables

The units:
P = [[Fluids#Pressure]]
V = Volume
n = number of moles
R = constant dependent on the units used(si units: **R = 8.314 J/molÂ·K**)
T = Temperature
k= a constant(This constant can vary it is just that it remains consant in the system)(Not in the PV = nRT)

### Adjacent ideal gas laws
$$\frac{P_1}{V_1}=\frac{P_2}{V_2}$$
$$PV=k$$
$$\frac{P_1V_2}{T_2}=\frac{P_2V_2}{T_2}$$
**This extends to any variation of the original equation**


# Kinetic-Molecular theory of Gases
- Gas collisions are elastic and thus do not loose kinetic energy
- Gas particles are tiny compared to the space between them? 
- 

# Root mean square speed
The root mean square speed is the average speed of a particle 
$$u_{rms}=\sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M_{m}}}$$
Where $M_m$ is the molar mass of the molecule in Kg because R is in Kg units
**Note**: This is dependent on the units within the R constant. Using Si units may differ from other units

Therefore:
$$
\begin{align}
u \propto \sqrt{T} \\
u \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{M_m}}
\end{align}
$$
