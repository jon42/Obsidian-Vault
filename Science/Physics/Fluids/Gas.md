Gasses will fill any space
this means that any number of gas molecules can fit any size

## Ideal gas law

The ideal gas law states that $PV = nRT$

This equation gives rise to many equations that relate two of the variables

The units:
P = [[Fluids#Pressure]]
V = Volume
n = number of moles
R = constant dependent on the units used(si units: **R = 8.314 J/molÂ·K**)
T = Temperature
k= a constant(This constant can vary it is just that it remains consant in the system)(Not in the PV = nRT)

### Adjacent ideal gas laws
$$\frac{P_1}{V_1}=\frac{P_2}{V_2}$$
$$PV=k$$
$$\frac{P_1V_2}{T_2}=\frac{P_2V_2}{T_2}$$
**This extends to any variation of the original equation**
