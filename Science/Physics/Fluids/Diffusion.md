Diffusion is the particles moving in a system.  This concept occurs in many areas of science

# Physics and Chem
In physics and chemistry Diffusion typically refers to gas particles moving around and filling a container

# Biology
In biology diffusion typically refers to the process of a molecule entering or leaving the cell.
## Passive diffusion
Passive diffusion is when a molecule is able to get passed the [[Lipid Bilayer and Cell Membrane|lipid bilayer]]. Molecules that can access the cell through passive diffusion are typically smaller slightly polar molecules.
# Facilitated Diffusion
Facilitated diffusion occurs when a molecules can not make it through the bilayer. This is typically larger molecules, charged molecules, or non-polar molecules. There are plenty of molecules that are accessed in this way

[[Proteins]] are the facilitators in this case. Complicated, often barel like, structures are formed that are designed to allow allow [[Molecule]]s to move in.

There are several factors to what allows a particle to move through one of these proteins; size, shape, and [[charge]] all play a major role in what keeps molecules out and in.
