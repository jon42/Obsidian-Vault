Electricity is energy resulting from the difference in [[charge]] in a system. This is often thought of as the [[Electron]] moving from the negatively charged part of a circuit to a more positively charge part.

# Units
## Volts
Symbol: V
The difference in charge between two points
## Amps
Symbol: I
The rate of flow of the particle

I = $V / {\ohm}$
## Ohms
Symbol: R or $\ohm$ 
Ohms is the measure of resistance in a circuit

## Watts
Symbol: W or P
Watts is the power output of the system. This is also called the Radian Flux.

W = I * V
W = $V^{2} /{\ohm}$ 
# Resistance
Resistance occurs in all conductors. 

Resistance in a wire is:: $$R=p( \frac{L}{A})$$ where p is the resistivity of the material, l is the length, and A is the area of the conductor
