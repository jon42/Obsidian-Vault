# Chromatids
Chromatids are an important part of the cell replication process. They are the duplicates synthesised during [[Cell Cycle#S]] Phase. 
## Centromere
The centromere is located near the centre of the chromatid. The centromere allows the [[Microtubels]] called kineticores to connect to them. This will allow the chromatids to move to the location that they need to be.
## Mitosis
Mitosis:: Cell replication in diploid cells
<!--ID: 1692599410696-->

Mitosis occurs in [[Cell Cycle#M phase]] in the cell cycle

### Pro-phase
Prophase:: The first stage in mitosis. 
<!--ID: 1692599410703-->

This is the stage when chromosomes condense
The kinetichores also start to extend
The spindle apparatus also forms at polar ends of the cell to start pulling them apart

### Prometaphase

This is when the nucleus breaks and kinetichore connect to the centromere

### Metaphase
Pro-Metaphase::
Metaphase:: Metaphase is when the Metaphase plate is formed by the sister chromatids being pulled to each end of the cell
<!--ID: 1696002543996-->

### Anaphase

This is the phase when the chromosomes split apart from the meta-phase plate and seperating each sister chromatid

### Telophase

Telophase is when the nuclear envelope starts to form around each chromosomes grouped. 
Spindle apparatus also disintigrates
Chromosomes decondense
Cytokenesis occurs and the cytoplasm devides making the two daughter cells



## Meiosis
Meiosis:: Cell replication in haploid cells. It consists of the same steps however rather than sister chromatids existing it is just a single one.
<!--ID: 1696998808069-->


Meiosis is cosnidered a "reduction division" because it takes a diploid cell and makes it haploid
<!--ID: 1692599410713-->

Meiosis can cause a diploid fungi to become haploid which is there normal state


# S phase
In meiosis there is still DNA replication

## M1
### Homologus Recombination
Homologus recombination is when the genetic material from the two parent cells are split increasing child variety
This happens at Prophase 1
This is achieved by something chiasma which is the bridge that connects the parent chromosomes
### Pro-phase 1

When the DNA is condensed and the kineticores start to extend

### Pro-metaphase 1
The nucleus will break and the microtubules will attach to the kineticores
### Metaphase 1
A metaphase plate is formed but rather that the chromosomes being pulled appart by the sister chromatid it is by each of the parent chromosomes
### Anaphase 1
The parent chromosomes will split apart and the parent sets will be moved to each different cells
### Telophase 1
The two cells split appart with only one side of each homolugus set


## M 2
### Pro-phase 2
New spindles form and start to move toward the centromere

### Pro-metaphase 2

### Metaphase 2
The metaphase plate occurs again in each of the daughter cells
### Anaphase 2
The sister chromatids will now seperate and start moving to the centrioles
### Telophase 2
The two cells then split into two more cells creating two cells for each parent chromosome.


## Non disjunction
When the meiosis goes wrong and the wrong number of chromosomes reach each side of the cell
