# Chromatids
Chromatids are an important part of the cell replication process. They are the duplicates synthesised during [[Cell Cycle#S]] Phase. 
## Centromere
The centromere is located near the centre of the chromatid. The centromere allows the [[Microtubels]] called kineticores to connect to them. This will allow the chromatids to move to the location that they need to be.
## Mitosis
Mitosis:: Cell replication in diploid cells
<!--ID: 1692599410696-->

Mitosis occurs in [[Cell Cycle#M phase]] in the cell cycle

### Pro-phase
Prophase:: The first stage in mitosis. 
<!--ID: 1692599410703-->

This is when the [[Microtubels]] in this case called a Keneticore [[DNA#Centromere]] 

### Metaphase
Pro-Metaphase::
Metaphase:: Metaphase is when the Metaphase plate is formed by the sister chromatids
<!--ID: 1696002543996-->


### Telophase
Telo
## Meiosis
Meiosis:: Cell replication in haploid cells. It consists of the same steps however rather than sister chromatids existing it is just a single one.
