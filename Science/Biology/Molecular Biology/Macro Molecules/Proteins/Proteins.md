Proteins:: are macro molecules responsible for doing things in the [[Cell]]. Proteins execute everything in cell.

# Structures
There are four types of protein structure
![[Pasted image 20230729163700.png]]
## Primary Structure
Protein primary structure:: When the amino acids that form the protein in a line.![[Pasted image 20230729163829.png]]
<!--ID: 1692599055362-->


## Secondary Structure
Protein secondary structure:: When the protein has undergone spontaneous folding. This includes structures called [[Proteins#Beta pleated sheets]], [[Proteins#Alpha Helix]], and [[Proteins#Random coils]].

### Beta pleated sheets
Similar to the alpha helix there are carboxyl and amino groups pointing at each other creating kinks which is the pleated sheets
### Alpha Helix
In an alpha helix the carboxyl and amino pointing at each other. This means that at every coil there is a hydrogen bond. 
### Random Coils
This is just the amino acids strung together in a random fasion that connects the alpha helix and beta pleated sheets
## Tertiary Structure

Protein tertiary structure:: The folding of a protein that occurs after entering the [[Golgi Apparatus]] and the [[Endoplasmic Reticulum]]. During this process [[Molecular Bonds#Covalent Bonds]] and other structures are added to the protein. This is the final form for many of the proteins in the [[Cell]].

### Quaternary Structure
Quaternary Structure:: This is the final possible structure obtainable by a protein. This is the structure when two or more tertiary structures are put together.

One of the primary examples of this is in hemoglobin. Hemoglobin consists of four heme sub-units. 2 alpha heme and two beta heme groups

# Enzymes
Enzymes:: Proteins that act as catalysts
<!--ID: 1692599055390-->

Enzymes are specific proteins that catalyze other reactions within a cell.


# Other interesting info
## Medicine
Protein folding is very important in the process of medicine. An attempt to understand how proteins may fold gives insight into how they would function and act in a cell. This means that there are many [[AI]] programs that are being created in hopes that they may be able to find a protein that is able to cure an illness.

## Prions 
Prions are misfolded proteins that can cause mass harm on living organisms. When the protein is misfolded it can cause a chain reaction that can cause other proteins to misfold and inhibit their function. This can be very serious and lead to death. Prion disease is what causes mad cow disease and in some cases [[Spillover]] into humans. These diseases are very problematic as the protein is a chemical structure not any virus or bacteria. This means that it is incredibly hard to get rid of them. Burning at hundreds of degrees c is one of the few ways scientists have found how to destroy them.

## Cooking
Protein structure is one of the key elements in how food tastes. How food is cooked changes this chemical structure and thus impact taste. This idea is how vegan alternatives are often produced. By facilitating the same proteins active in meet products the vegan products can achieve the same taste.
