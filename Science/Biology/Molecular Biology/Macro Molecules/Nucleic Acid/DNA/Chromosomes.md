Chromosomes are groups of genes in a sequence
The amount of genes that are on each chromosome. There are organisms with a single chromosome that holds all the genes in their body while others can have thousands of chromosomes as short as a single gene.
In the case of humans there are 23 chromosomes


# Homologous chromosomes

# Ploidy
Ploidy refers to the number of homolgous chromosomes exist for each chromosome. In the case of humans we are diploid meaning we have 2 copies of each chromosomes (Except for X and Y in "men").  Archaea and bacteria are **haploid** and only have a single copy of each chromosome. The majority of eukaryotes are diploid.
## Why diploid
There are a few benifits of having copies of genes
### Biodiversity
By the principle of segregation and [[Cell replication#Homologus Recombination]] there are endless possiblities for allele combinations.

### Deactivation
There are some cases in which there are alleles of genes that are harmful or malfunctioning in some other way. When there is one of these malfunctioning genes. 
One of the key examples of this is in colour blindness. The colourblindness gene is located on the x chromosome. This means that if there is a defective one an XX individual can make up for it but a XY person cannot. This is why men have a higher rate of colourblindness.
