RNA::: is a single stranded nucleic acid that stores information over a short time. 

There are several different types of RNA that are crucial to the function of the [[Cell]].

## Differences from DNA
- Single stranded
- Uses Uracil rather than Thymine

## Types of RNA

### mRNA

mRNA:: The type of RNA is the used in the process of [[Translation]] and [[Transcription]].

#### Pre-mRNA
Pre-mRNA:: eukaryotic mRNA that has not undergone [[Transcription#Alternative spicing]].

### tRNA
tRNA:: Transfer RNA. Used to move the [[Amino Acid]] to the [[Proteins#Primary Structure]] during the process of [[Translation]].

tRNA is RNA that carries an amino acid to the [[Ribosomes]] during translation. They have a triple loop structure with an [[Amino Acid#Anti-Codon]] on the end of it.

### siRNA
si-RNA:: Short Interfering RNA that is involved in [[Gene Regulation]]
