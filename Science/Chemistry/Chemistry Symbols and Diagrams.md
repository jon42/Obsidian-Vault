# Modern Diagrams
## Periodic table
The most well know method of displaying the known atoms![[Pasted image 20230825141823.png]]
Color Key: {red: Alkaline Metal} {Yellow: Alkaline earth medals} {Salmon: Transition Metals} {Grey: Post transition metals} {Beige: Metaloids} {Light yell: Reactive nonmetals} {Turqiose: Noble gasses} {White: Unknown} {Pink: Ianthanides} {Purple: Actinides}
Periodic tables vary in the some of the information displayed
Groups are the columns of the periodic table. The first three and last three share the same [[Ions|Ion]] charge in the entire group. (see [[Ions]] for more info)
Periods are the rows in the periodic table
Colours will often indicate what type of atom a cell is these atoms usually share similar properties
### Molar mass
Molar mass is defined as the amount of mass one mole of an atom would have on average. This uses the average mass of the most common [[Isotopes]]. This number is typically under the atomic symbol and the name of the atom
### Atomic number
This indicates how many electrons are in the atom
### Atomic symbol
This is the two letters in the middle of the card. It is typically used when referencing an atom
## Chemical Diagrams
There are a few ways that chemical diagrams are represented in modern chemistry
### Skeletal formula
This is the most widely used chemical diagram. In these diagram there are a lot of shorthand techniques that make drawing the chemical formulas faster
```smiles
C=1C-C=CCC1
```
In the example above it as though very little information is presented however it is just follows a few simple rules
- Vertexes are carbons
- lines are bonds
- The number of lines determines how many bonds there are
- Carbon always has 4 bonds. Therefore if there is less than four hydrogen is also bounded to the carbon
```smiles
S[As@@TB1](F)(Cl)(Br)N
```
### Lewis Structure
The Lewis structure is one of the most simple ways of displaying an chemical

In lewis diagrams each atomic symbol is shown. Each bond is shown through a line and dots represent other electrons not involved in bonding
In the diagram above note that the hydrogen electrons are used in the bond, however the electrons from oxygen are not so they are shown
