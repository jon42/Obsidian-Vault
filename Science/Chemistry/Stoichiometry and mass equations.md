Stoichiometry is the process of creating rations of mass and number of atoms or moles
I honestly don't know why this is an entire unit


Examples:
$$2H_2+O_{2} {\rightarrow} 2H_2O$$
The Hydrogen and oxygen are both diatomic so to create an equal number of atoms two water [[Molecule]] are needed
$$Mg(s) + O_{2} \rightarrow 2MgO$$::$$2Mg+O_{2} \rightarrow 2MgO$$

Molar mass defines how many grams are in one mole of an atom

This process can be tedious but is not very challenging
