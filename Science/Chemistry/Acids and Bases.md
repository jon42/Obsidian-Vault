# Bronsted-lowry Definition
Acid: A molecule that gives up a proton/Hydrogen ion
Base: Anything that accepts a proton

These definitions are broad and encompass many things. An odd example of a base is water. Although its pH is 7 $H_{2}O$ can obtain another hydrogen atom to become hydronium ($H_{3}O$). This is important to see who is the receptor and who is giving when defining an acid or a base.
