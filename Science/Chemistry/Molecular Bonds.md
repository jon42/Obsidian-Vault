Types of Molecular Bonds:: Ionic, Covalent, Hydrogen, and Vander-Walls force
<!--ID: 1692597038788-->

# Ionic Bonds
Ionic bonds form between:: Metal and Non-metal or [[Ions#Poly-atomic ions]]. The ionic bonding occurs when the [[Ions]] cancel charges. Ionic bonds occur when an atom with 1-3 valence electrons complete the orbital of the other atom

# Covalent Bonds
Covalent bonds form between:: Non-Metals. Covalent bonds share electrons between the two atoms. These bonds can happen so long as the shared [[Electron]]  move the atom closer to having a complete orbital

Covalent bonds are more common than ionic bonds
# Hydrogen Bonds
Hydrogen bonds:: Hydrogen bonds form when an electron is pulled towards one atom more than then other creating a charge difference. This can only happen if the electronegativity of the two atoms is greater than 1.5 making it [[Hydrophobic and Hydrophylic|polar]]. See [[Hydrophobic and Hydrophylic|polar molecuels]] for more. 


# Vander-Waals force
These are the weakest form of bonds in a system.
