# Full Molecular equation
In a full molecular equation shows each molecule involved and the states that they are in.

Example: $$2NaCl(aq)+Pb(NO_{3})_{2}(aq){\to} 2NaNO_{3}(aq)+PbCl_{2}(s)$$
# Full Ionic equation
In the full ionic equation soluble molecules are written separately and their charges are included

Example:$$
\begin{align}
2Na^{+}(aq)+2Cl^{-}(aq)+Pb^{2+}(aq)+2NO_{3}{\to}\\
2Na^{+}(aq)+2NO_{3}^{-}(aq)+PbCl_{2}(s)
\end{align}$$
# Net Ionic equation
In the net ionic equation of reacted molecules are written
Example:$$Pb^{2+}(aq)+2Cl^{-}(aq){\to}PbCl_2(s)$$
There are some important distinctions when writing net ionic. The first is that it includes all of the molecules that are reacted. This includes if there is a water product it is written. It is also based on the original equation so if there are two of the molecules it must remain through the net ionic process.
