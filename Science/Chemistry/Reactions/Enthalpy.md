The enthalpy of a reaction is the change in energy.
It is denoted as $\Delta H$ 
A positive $\Delta H$ is an endothermic reaction as it is requiring more energy
A negative $\Delta H$ is exothermic as it releases excess energy

# $\Delta H$ of phases 
Each phase will take a different amount of energy to increase the temperature and to change the phases
