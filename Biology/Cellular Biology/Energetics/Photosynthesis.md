Photosynthesis is arguably the most important reaction in the world. The photosynthetic process not only provides the energy form plants, it also provides the oxygen necessary for [[Cellular Respiration|Aerobic Respiration]] 
That means that photosynthesis is responsible for almost all larger organisms on this planet. 
Photosynthesis occurs in the [[Chloroplast]]
# Light Cycle
![[Pasted image 20240320130441.png]]![[Pasted image 20240320130522.png]]
The first step in the photosynthesis cycle is the light cycle. The light cycle produces [[Energy Molecules#ATP]] and [[Energy Molecules#NADPH]]  for the [[Photosynthesis#Dark Cycle/Calvin Cycle]] to use.
## Pigments
Photosynthesis uses pigments to absorb the energy from photons
The reason that many plants are green is that they use pigments that absorb all light except for green light. 
### Light-Harvesting Complex/Antenna
The antenna is an array of proteins and chlorophyll moleculse that are in the [[Chloroplast#Thylakoid]] membrane.
The antenna pigments are what absorbs the light energy and move it to the reaction center. The reaction center is either [[Photosynthesis#Photosystem II]] or [[Photosynthesis#Photosystem I]].
When the chlorophyll absorbs a [[Photon]] the energy from the photon is absorbed into the electron. 
The energy from the electron is passed down through other pigments till it reaches the reaction center.

## Photosystem II
Photosystem II is the first protein in the photosynthetic process. 
Although it is first in the cycle it is called photosystem 2 because it was the second photosystem discovered. 
It is located in the [[Chloroplast#Thylakoid]]
After photosystem 2 has the excited electron it uses the energy to [[Oxidation and Reduction|Oxidize]] $2H_{2}O$ forming $O_{2}+H_{2}^{+}+e^-$ 
## Photosynthesis ETC
These electrons are later passed to a molecule called plastoquinone. It is then moved to the cytochrom complex. As it moves it is releasing energy and allowing $H^+$ to be pumped across the [[Chloroplast#Thylakoid]] Membrane. This forms an $H^+$  gradient for [[ATPsynthase]] to produce [[Energy Molecules#ATP]] later used in the [[Photosynthesis#Dark Cycle/Calvin Cycle]]. After it is passed to [[Photosynthesis#Photosystem I]].

## Photosystem I
Photosystem 1 is the second photosystem in the biological process. After the ETC the electron has lost almost all of its energy. This means that Photosystem 1 must also use a [[Photosynthesis#Light-Harvesting Complex/Antenna]] to obtain energy from a photon. Photosystem 1 then uses the excited electron to produce [[Energy Molecules#NADPH]]

# Dark Cycle/Calvin Cycle
The dark cycle is an important piece of the photosynthesis process
This is the part in photosynthesis where $CO_{2}$ is recycled to form glucose and $O_2$. 
The calvin cycle occurs in the [[Chloroplast#Stroma]] of the [[Chloroplast]]

## Fixation
Fixation is the first stage of the Calvin cycle.
fixation involves the combination of $CO_2$ and [[Photosynthesis#RuBP]]. When this happens it forms a molecule that is very unstable so it splits into two molecules of phosphoglyceric acid.  
### RuBP
RuBP is an acceptor molecule with the structure of
```smiles
O=P(O)(O)Occ(=O)[c@@](O)[c@@](O)COP(O)(O)=O
```
## 3-Phosphoglyceric Acid
Phosphoglyceric acid is an energy molecule used in the dark cycle of photosynthesis
```smiles
Oc(=O)c(o)cop(o)(o)=o
```
## Reduction



## Regeneration
