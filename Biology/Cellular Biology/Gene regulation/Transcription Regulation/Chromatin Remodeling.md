Chromatin refers to tightly DNA is packed into the nucleus. 

DNA that is tightly bound prevents [[RNA Polymerase]] from binding to the DNA. If the RNA Polymerase cannot bind then [[Transcription]] cannot occur and [[mRNA]] or proteins can form. 

There are many ways in which this may happen.

# Euchromatin

Euchromatin refers to DNA that is loosely bound. This DNA is often [[Transcription|Transcribed]] 

# Heterochromatin
