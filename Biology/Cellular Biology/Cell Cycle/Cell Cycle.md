## Interphase
Interphase:: The regular growth of the cell
<!--ID: 1692599187465-->

<!--SR:!2023-07-31,4,270-->
Consists of three parts: G1, S, and G2
This phase is interrupted by the mitosis or [[Cell Cycle#Interphase#Meiosis]].

### G1
G1:: The first phase of the cell cycle
<!--ID: 1692599187477-->

This phase is to ensure that the cell reaches a satifactory size and organells 
### S
S:: Synthesis phase of the cell cycle
<!--ID: 1692599187488-->

This is when the [[DNA]] gets replicated
Before this phase the chromosomes do not form the x shape and are just in a normal state.
After this occurs there are now the two sister chromatids that exist in [[Cell Cycle#M phase]] or [[Cell replication]]

The centromere also exist at this stage

### G2
G2:: The third phase in the cell cycle
<!--ID: 1692599187499-->
This phase is very similar to [[Cell Cycle#G1]]

### M phase
M phase is:: [[Cell replication]]
<!--ID: 1692599187509-->
