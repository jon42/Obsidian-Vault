The Endoplasmic reticulum is apart of the [[Nucleus#Nuclear Envelop]] that assist in [[Translation]] 

The Endoplasmic reticulum is a single structure, however, it is made of 2 distinct parts that serve different purposes.

# Rough ER
The rough ER is a rough looking structure with [[Ribosomes]] attached to it. 
The ribosomes associated with the rough ER will create proteins that are sent to other destinations such as organells or the [[Lipid Bilayer and Cell Membrane|cell membrane]]. 
The inside of the rough ER is called the lumen
Proteins that are created in the rough ER can serve any number of purposes
# Smooth ER
The smooth ER catalyzes reactions that are required in the production of lipids. . It can also break down lipids and other molecules that are harmful to the cell.
