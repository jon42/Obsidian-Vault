Transcription is the process in which [[DNA]] is turned into [[RNA]]. Translation is facilitated by an [[Proteins#Enzymes]] [[RNA Polymerase]]. 

## Transcription Process
### Transcription Initiation
- **Initiation**: [[RNA Polymerase]] binds to a [[Promoter sequence]] and creates a bubble in the DNA sequence.

### Transcription Elongation 
- **Elongation**: There is the template strand that the RNA polymerase will bind to. The enzyme will then move in the 5' -> 3' direction. As it moves it will add complimentary [[Nucleotide]] to the end of the RNA. ![[Pasted image 20230722172749.png]]
### Transcription Termination
- **Termination**: When the RNA polymerase reaches a terminators signal the transcript is complete. There are many ways that this can happen. One example is the RNA will form a hairpin and detatch.![[Pasted image 20230722173243.png]]


## Transcription is Prokaryotes vs Eukaryotes

Transcription occurs a bit differently in [[Eukaryotes]] and [[Prokaryotes]]. The main difference is that transcription occurs in the [[Nucleus]] in Eukaryotes and in the [[Cytosol]]. There is also changes in the mRNA described in [[Transcription#Eukaryotic RNA modification]] 

## RNA Modification

RNA can go through different modifications after they are transcribed and before they are [[Translation|Translate]]d.

### Eukaryotic RNA modification

[[RNA#mRNA]] will go through a process in [[Eukaryotes]] that allows for a more possibilities with the same number of [[Amino Acid]]s. There is a chance that some of these changes are in [[Prokaryotes]].

#### RNA end Caps
After RNA is [[Transcription|Transcribed]] a 5' cap and a poly-[[Nucleotide#Adenosine]] cap is added. These are added to allow the [[RNA#mRNA]] to be more stable and aids in 

#### Alternative spicing

Alternative splicing is when the [[Amino Acid#Introns]] and exons are removed and different combination of [[Amino Acid#Exons]] are used. By including or excluding [[Amino Acid#Exons]] the final [[mRNA]] can create different [[Proteins]] that can serve different purposes. [[RNA#Pre-mRNA]] is the term for the mRNA before it is spliced.
