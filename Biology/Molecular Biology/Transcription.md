Transcription is the process in which [[DNA]] is turned into [[RNA]]. Translation is facilitated by an [[Enzyme]] [[RNA Polymerase]]. 
- In [[Eukaryotes]] RNA is transcribed in the Nucleus but in [[Prokaryotes]] it happens in the [[Cytoplasm]]. 
## Transcription Process
- **Initiation**: [[RNA Polymerase]] binds to a [[Promoter sequence]] and creates a bubble in the DNA sequence. ![[Pasted image 20230722172409.png]]
- **Elongation**: There is the template strand that the RNA polymerase will bind to. The enzyme will then move in the 5' -> 3' direction. As it moves it will add another [[Nucleotide]] to the end of the RNA. ![[Pasted image 20230722172749.png]]
- **Termination**: When the RNA polymerase reaches a terminators signal the transcript is complete. There are many ways that this can happen. One example is the RNA will form a hairpin and detatch.![[Pasted image 20230722173243.png]]
RNA can go through different modifications after they are transcribed.

In eukaryotes [[mRNA]] is modified to have a 5' cap and and poly-[[Nucleotide#Adenosine|Adenosine]] tail.
