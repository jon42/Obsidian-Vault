Enzymes are a type of protein that catalyses a reaction.


# Examples
EDX: 
Trios Phosphate Isomerase also known as Tim:
This enzyme reduces the activation energy to create an [[Isomer]] of the [[Saccharide]]. This enzyme allow it to lower the [[Activation Barrier]] of the saccaride so that it can create the isomer. It does this by positioning itself in a way that it can hold the saccaride in place and creates weak bonds. that are able to take a hydrogen, change the molecular structure, and give up a hydroge. When tim is involved the speed happens in a $10^{10}$ it is a "perfect enzyme" as it is limited not by itself but by diffusion.
For an idea of how much a single change in an amino acid can make there is an example of when a polar-charged amino acid is exchanged with another but the efficiency drops by 1000x. This change was a single carbon atom.
