Lipids:: a macro molecules in the [[Cell]]. Lipids consist of a [[Hydrophobic and Hydrophylic|Hydrophobic]] tail and a [[Hydrophobic and Hydrophylic|Hydrophylic]] head group.

This means that when placed in water it is very confused and simultanuosly creates hydrogen bonds and avoids them. This is the core principle creating the [[Lipid Bilayer and Cell Membrane]].
# Structure
## Head
The head of a lipid is:: Hydrophilic. It is made from a carbon with a double bond oxygen and single bond hydroxide

```smiles
OC(=O)cccc
```
## Tail
The tail consists of hydrocarbons in a string
```smiles
OC(=O)ccccccc
```
### Saturated
Saturated lipid:: A lipid without a double bonded carbon in the tail
<!--ID: 1692734890688-->

### Unsaturated
Unsaturated lipid:: A lipid with a double bonded carbon in the tail
<!--ID: 1692734890697-->

```smiles
OC(=O)ccccc=cccc
```
this creates a kink in the chemical structure
