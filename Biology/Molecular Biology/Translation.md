## Translation is the process in which [[RNA]] is turned into [[Proteins]] 

[[mRNA]] is translated using [[Ribosomes]] in the [[Cytosol]]. The ribosomes will attach a [[tRNA]] to each [[Nucleotide]] found on the RNA. The process will take place at different times in [[Eukaryotes]] and [[Prokaryotes]]. In both the process occurs in the [[Cytosol]] however because in prokaryotes [[Translation]] occurs in the [[Nucleus]] the [[mRNA]] must first move out of a [[Nucleus#Nuclear Pore| nuclear pore]]. Prokaryotes also don't require any [[Eukaryotic RNA modification#Alternative spicing|Alternative splicing]] This means that translation and transcription can happen nearly simultaneously in prokaryotes.

## Process of Translation
The Process of translation has the same 3 steps as the [[Transcription#Transcription Process|transcription process]].
### Translation Initiation
- Translation Initiation:: Initiation starts when the ribosomes [[Ribosomes#Preinitation complex]] searches the 5' cap on the mRNA. Once this is found the large ribosome will attach itself to make the ribosome complex. The ribosome will then move in the 3' direction until it reaches a start [[Amino Acid#Codon]]. After it reaches this start codon it will start the elongation process.

### Translation Elongation
- Translation Elongation:: When elongation occurs the ribosome will match the [[Nucleotide]] to a complimentary [[RNA#tRNA]]. The tRNA will add an [[Amino Acid]] to the [[Proteins]] chain by fitting into the [[Ribosomes#P site]]. The complimentary [[RNA#tRNA]] is chosen based on having a matching [[Amino Acid#Anti-Codon]]. The ribosome will continue down in the 3' direction adding to the amino acid chain.

### Translation Termination
- Translation Termination:: Termination occurs when the [[Ribosomes]] reach a stop [[Amino Acid#Codon]]. Stop codons trigger other proteins called [[Proteins#Release factors]] to detach the [[Proteins|peptide]] from the [[Ribosomes]]. Once this process is finished [[Proteins#Protein folding]] occurs.
