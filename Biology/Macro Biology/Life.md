# What is a living organism
This is a surprisingly complicated question. Many disagree on what defines a living thing. One of the most frequently debated questions is whether or not viruses are alive. First, to even broach that question standards must be decided on.
Bio 204 standards:
- Membrane bound cell
- Metabalize
- Evolve
- Store genetic information

Based on these standards the questions about viruses are still not answered. Viruses are effectively transporters of genetic information in a membrane bound cell. An interesting comparison is that if the viruses are living then DNA itself would be living, although I don't think that that is a fair comparison.
