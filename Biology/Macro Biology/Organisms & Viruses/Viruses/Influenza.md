Influenza has a vary cool method of releasing its genetic contents into the cell.
1. It will attach the outer cell wall and then use [[Cytokenesis]] to enter the cell in a [[Vacule]]. 
2. once it is inside the vacule [[Proteins#Alpha Helix]] structures are formed.
3. When the [[Acids and Bases#pH]] goes down the alpha helix extends and penetrates into the membrane with a [[Hydrophobic and Hydrophylic|Hydrophobic]] end. 
4. When the pH continues to rise the alpha helix bends and combines the membrane with the virus membrane and allows the [[RNA]] to be released
