# Taxonomy
Taxonomy is the broad categorisation of species. There is a long deep history of taxa and how it relates to phylogeny. 
# Phylogeny
Phylogeny is those funky trees that show genetic variation. 

## Reading and Creating Phylogenic trees

### Elements of a Phylogenic tree
#### Root 
The root is the oldest ancestor of all of the species on a photogenic tree. 
#### Nodes
Nodes are each intersection between species
#### Tip 
Tips is the species at the end of each branch
### Topology
Topology refers to the overall structure of the tree. The most important aspect of topology is the relation of species but not the order of them. This means that if a branch is rotated but the order in which species deviate is the same it has the same topology.

### Polytomy
Polytomy refers to a node with 3 or more branches stemming off of it. These are generally considered to be unknown lineages. There are some cases in which they are assumed to split off evenly, although these are uncommon. 
## Parsimony
Parsimony refers to the number of steps that a trait needed to occur. Convergent evolution is when a trait is gained by species at different point. The instance in which the trait is gained/lost the fewest amount of times is likely to be correct. This is called most parsimonious. There can be several methods to reach the most parsimonious tree.

### Homology 
Homology is when a characteristic is shared by two or more individuals that was gained from a common ancestor
### Homoplasy
Homoplasy is a shared characteristic that is gained independently.
## Types of Phylogenic trees
### Cladogram
Cladogram is the most common and simple tree. These trees just show the relation between species.
### Phylogram
Phylogram is a phylogenic tree that the extent of the branches shoes the amount of genetic difference.
### Chronogram
Chronogram is when the branches of the phylogenic tree represent the amount of time that has passed between separation of species. These can also have shorter tips to indicate that a species went extinct.
