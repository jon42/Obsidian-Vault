# Gibbs Free Energy
Gibbs free energy refers to the spontaneity of a reaction
Gibbs free energy is denoted as $\Delta G$ 
Negative $\Delta G$ refers to a spontaneous reaction and a positive is non spontantious.
## Calculating $\Delta G$ 
The Formula for caluclating $\Delta G$ is:$$\Delta G=\Delta H-T\Delta S$$ where $\Delta H$ is [[Enthalpy]] and $\Delta S$ is [[Entropy]].
