6.7 million americans suffer from alzheimers
1 in 3 seniors suffer
costs 354 billion$ in the us in 2023

Alzheimers is often diagnosed after death
It has amyloid plaques and neurofibrullary tangles

The diagnosis cannot be confirmed until after death

Only 7-8 percent of cases are known genetic causes
95% are unknown genetics

There are three genes that are known to cause alzheimers
This is only a small portion of the genes

Lookin at other genes there is a high variability in the data
There are some genes with a higher risk although the rates are still unknown

# if genetics are complicated how do we decrease risk of alzheimers

- Eating well
- Excersize
- Social interaction
- Sleep

These dont prevent but decrease the risk

When there is AD there is a change in almost all of the cell types within the brain. Not just one


There are many genes that are invovlved in endocytosis (processing and dispose of proteins) and immune response

Microglia are the innate immune cell in the central nervous system
They act as a macrophages within the cell. 
Microglia are constantly surveying the synapses
They release factors to allow the neurons to survive

Microglia react to stimulous and activate. If they are not deactivated it will lose its function. This is presumed to be a key player in AD

Microglia migrate to sites of injury. 
This migration also applies to amyloid plaques that exist in AD

Microglia make up 2-10 precent of brain cells

# The research
They used a technology to isolate nucleus
This allows them to gain the RNA and convert it to cRNA
This allows them to sequence the RNA that is in the cell
This allows them to understand what is happening at a single gene level

There was a larger study from 22 humans
There were 12 with AD and 10 control

When the genes were mapped there were about 10 different types of microglia that had different gene expression

Two of these types have a different rate in controls vs AD individuals

After determining the two specific microglia their function was assessed

Endolysosomal network(ELN): A cells garbae. Allows the excess material to be process or recycled

Three of the the populations seem to have a large connection to the ELN
At least one of the types of cells overlapped with the AD and control cells


Images were captured of lysosomes in microglia in different stages of activation. 

Hypothesis in the field:Enlarged early endosomes are early AD pathology
This is because they believe that the cause of AD comes from Endosomal recycling

There are 2 paths in dimentia
Those with pathology and show pathology but have no symptoms
Question: How do individuals live with pathology


The resilient individuals have a lower gene expression than even those that are resistent
